# lantern_schools_quiz
A school quiz competition management system designed to allow schools put their students to the test with students from other schools through quizzes. It provides a leaderboard showcasing the best students, along with their prided school name. A fun project I wanted after a friend showed me Kahoot. :)

1st day - My thought process is to come up with the UI while listening to Tems on Spotify. hopefully i finish this before 3am.
i'll also think of the api for each student and school. All the best.
